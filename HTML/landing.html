            <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">We are going to be discovering any and all factors that lead to a winning match during a friendly neighborhood game of Among Us. We will be looking at all factors including but not limited to game length, time of day that the game is played, the number of sabotages fixed, whether or not the crewmate or imposter was ejected, the time to complete all the tasks, whether or not the crewmate was murdered, and last but not least the outcome of the game. We will be completing various aspects of data cleaning and machine learning, and then will be visualizing our findings with Tableau. If you are unfamiliar with the game of Among Us, please read the short description on how to play below!</p>

            <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Among Us is basically a game of survival, where you either have to vote off all of the imposters and complete all the tasks, and the imposter has to kill all of the crewmates or stop them from completing the designated tasks to win. If you are designated a crewmate your task is to find the imposter. Of course, being an imposter is a lot more fun as you can betray and kill your friends.</p>
            <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">An imposter needs to kill the crewmates and ensure no one is able to get out of the locations. Players can also vote off other players from the location. Note, if you have a huge number of players (up to 10 players), you can also select to have multiple imposters(up to 3 imposters). No crew member can talk while performing tasks, until and unless a death is reported. When someone dies, the crew gets a chance to vote and root out the imposter.</p>
            <p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">When a player dies, they will become a ghost, who can explore the map without colliding with the walls. However, they are not visible to the living Crew and can only be seen by other ghosts. Their communication system is limited, as they can only interact with other dead or ejected players, and they cannot resolve Sabotage. If they are a Crewmate, they can still complete tasks. In the same way, Impostor ghosts can still Sabotage to disrupt the Crewmates who are still alive.</p>
