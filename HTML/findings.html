                  <h4>Our final thoughts on this project mainly revolve around game strategy, 
                    as all three of us have become avid players in the recent months. 
                    Our goal was to identify any potential factors in the game that led to a 
                    larger outcome of winning either as a Crewmate or as an imposter. 
                    What we were able to uncover after extensive machine learning is that 
                    game length plays a significant factor in the outcome of a game. 
                    We then built visualizations displaying this factor against the outcome 
                    of the game and included other factors as well that were also slightly 
                    important. We saw that the longer that a game lasts while remaining in session
                     means that the number of Crewmates is decreasing and the imposter or imposters, 
                     have not been ejected yet. Therefore, we expected to see an increase in number 
                     of wins of a game during the early stages as opposed to the later stages 
                     where the ratio of Crewmates to Imposters is larger. 
                     We also deduced that perhaps there is a switch in priorities towards the end of the game, 
                     where identifying the imposter is of less importance, and completing all tasks before everyone dies is of more importance.</h2>
