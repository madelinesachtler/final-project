# AMONG US 

Welcome one, welcome all!

We are going to be discovering any and all factors that lead to a winning match during a friendly neighborhood game of Among Us. We will be looking at all factors including but not limited to game length, time of day that the game is played, the number of sabotages fixed, whether or not the crewmate or imposter was ejected, the time to complete all the tasks, whether or not the crewmate was murdered, and last but not least the outcome of the game. We will be completing various aspects of data cleaning and Machine learning, and then will be visualizing our findings with Tableau.
